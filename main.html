      <h1>Discussing the <br> elephant in the blender</h1>
      <p>Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.
        <br>
        <br>
        Well, we're three brothers, Ashkan, Arman, and Kian, who envisioned Devlumination. It emerged from our collective desire to create a unified platform that simplifies the job hunting process for fresh software developers and college grads.
        We're not about idleness; we're about empowerment. Devlumination is the culmination of countless discussions, brainstorming sessions, and engaging with job seekers like you.
        <br>
        <br>
        We aimed for an intuitive platform that provides valuable resources, insights, and networking opportunities to guide your career journey. Devlumination combines networking, up-to-date news, job hunting strategies, career roadmaps, and more. What you witness is just the beginning.
        <br>
        <br>
        We call it a blend, for Devlumination aspires to encompass everything we craved during our job hunting experience, helping you illuminate your path to success.</p>
